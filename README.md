Pdf Sorter
==========

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/KentCommunications/pdfSorter-java.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/KentCommunications/pdfSorter-java)

Prerequisites
-------------

  - [Oracle Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  installed and properly configured.
  - A [Free GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free).

Preparing to Hack
-----------------

Once you have [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) installed,
you should clone this repo into your favorite working directory.

#### Clone

    cd <working directory>
    git clone git@github.com:KentCommunications/pdfSorter-java.git pdfsorter
    cd pdfsorter

Next we should make sure [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) is working.

#### Gradle

We have included the Gradle Wrapper in our project, to help make it easier for everyone.
All you need to do in order to make sure Gradle is working properly is run gradlew (gradlew.bat for windows users):

    ./gradlew assemble

this should have output which looks similar to this:

    :compileJava
    :processResources
    :classes
    :jar
    :assemble

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL

    Total time: 0.06 secs

If you get an error, your JDK is probably incorrectly configured.

#### Testing

Lastly, we need to make sure the test suite runs as expected. we use gradle here too, just run:

    ./gradlew test

If everything passes, you are ready to begin hacking.
